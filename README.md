## Grokking algorithms by Aditya Bhargava

Grokking algorithms is an excellent book by Aditya Bhargava on, well, algorithms.
It's a great way to get one's feet wet with some popular algorithms and the concepts behind them.

This repo holds the code I wrote while going through the book.
The files contain implementations of some popular algorithms in python.
